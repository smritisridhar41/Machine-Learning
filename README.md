MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS - SELF LEARNING

This repository contains all the basic machine learning examples which I had written as part of learning the various concepts.

1. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Multi-Class Logistic Regression: These are the excercises I implemented as part of the Machine Learning online course by Andrew Ng.

2.Convolution Examples: Here are three examples of how convolution can be used to alter image/audio files:-

    Echo effect
    Blurring of an image
    Edge detection in an image

To get an idea of how using Convolution in an ANN helps in extracting features.
